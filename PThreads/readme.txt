The diffrent files make a counter function that runs with threads.There are diffrent locks, or no locks on each file.Most of the threading infomation on how to get them to work was from  https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/.For the locks I used the site mentioned earlier and wikipedia.The make file complies all of the files and names the exe to the file name without the extension.
